# dijkstra-algorithm-for-a-point-robot-in-continuos-space

##Instructions to run.

clone the files from GitHub by typing:
git clone https://github.com/Madhunc5229/dijkstra-algorithm-for-a-point-robot-in-continuos-space

cd dijkstra-algorithm-for-a-point-robot-in-continuos-space

python SourceCode.py

##About the program and inputs:

When you run the program, it will ask for four outputs that is x cordinate of start point, y cordinate of start point, x cordinate of goal point and y cordinate of goal point. 

If the points are not valid, it will ask again (please give points which are not in obstacle space to get the solution)

After the goal is reached, the program displays the vizualization of the exploring the points and when the goal is reached it shows the backtracked image in a new window. 

PLEASE PRESS Q AFTER SEEING THE VIDEO AND IMAGE, this will record the video of vizualization and store it as "Dijkstra.mp4" in the working directory.
