# dijkstra-algorithm-for-a-point-robot-in-continuos-space

##Instructions to run.

#Option 1:
cd to folder containing the extracted files of "myPackage".

run the command:

python Dijkstra-pathplanning-Madhu-NarraChittibabu.py

#Option 2:

clone the files from GitHub by typing:
git clone https://github.com/Madhunc5229/dijkstra-algorithm-for-a-point-robot-in-continuos-space

cd dijkstra-algorithm-for-a-point-robot-in-continuos-space

python SourceCode.py


##Files in the folder
if the the zip is extracted, you will find 3 videos, one source code (with naming convention) and readme file.
The three videos are:
1. "CornerToCorner.mp4" - This is recorded video of the program exploring all nodes and find path between corner to corner.
2. "ShorterDIstPoints.mp4" - This is recorded video of program exploring and finding path between two random points.
3. "screenrecord.mp4" - This is screen recorded video of running the program and seeing the vizualization.


##About the program and inputs:

When you run the program, it will ask for four outputs that is x cordinate of start point, y cordinate of start point, x cordinate of goal point and y cordinate of goal point. 

If the points are not valid, it will ask again (please give points which are not in obstacle space to get the solution)

After the goal is reached, the program displays the vizualization of the exploring the points and when the goal is reached it shows the backtracked image in a new window. 

PLEASE PRESS Q AFTER SEEING THE VIDEO AND IMAGE, this will record the video of vizualization and store it as "Dijkstra.mp4" in the working directory.
